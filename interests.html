                  In all honesty, the interest is eating. All related
                  interests are just a vehicle for eating. But I also enjoy
                  cooking, going to new restaurants, food photography, and
                  writing about food. I also really like craft beers and
                  ciders and spend way too much time at breweries because
                  there are too many good small batch releases.

                  I'm a big fan of walking. Doesn't have to be out in the
                  woods or on a scenic trail or anything, but a good bit of
                  that is nice once in a while too. I have a dog,
                  affectionately referred to as <em>Big Dog</em>, and even
                  though he's a lazy bum like I am, he's also a
                  <strong>BIG BOY</strong> (lab, shepherd mix) and he needs
                  his exercise.

                  Sometimes we go on hikes, sometimes we just walk around
                  town, sometimes we just do laps around the neighborhood. I
                  like to listen to music or just rant about people stuff to
                  him. Dogs are great listeners.

                  Manga + anime. I'm in pretty deep. I watch a lot of
                  seasonals and have read or watched a lot of the classics,
                  and I've got a fair bit of merch to show for it too. I also
                  like gunpla. I don't know anything about Gundam. But gunpla
                  is very fun. Next project: EVA Lobsters.

                  Video games. Not as much as before because I'm too poor for
                  nice things. Don't currently have a PC that can run
                  anything. Used to be a support main in LOL, but the highest
                  I ever got was Diamond II RIP. Still follow LCS because I
                  live for the fiesta. I have a PS4 and a Switch but the only
                  games I get on release are Resident Evil and random JRPGs
                  that catch my interest.

                  Writing. Mostly creative writing, mostly prose, sometimes
                  poetry. Sometimes I have a really rough day and just ramble
                  write nonsense until I feel better. Kind of like what this
                  project text is starting to sound like. <em>Uh oh...</em>

                  Visual art is exceedingly difficult for me. I don't have
                  mental images. <em>At all.</em> Picture a tree. A square,
                  even. A color. Could you do it? I can't! I can't picture
                  anything, so I don't think visually at all. Drawing involves
                  a lot of drawing and erasing and redrawing because I won't
                  know if it's right until it's wrong. Which is awful. But
                  it's still fun somehow. Occasionally.

                  Resin crafting. I like making molds of stuff. Pouring resin
                  is fun too but I don't have the patience required to wait
                  for it to dry all the time. Polymer clay is fun to work with
