Future Implementations:
* Splash Screen!
* Scrollspy ?

Challenges:
* Carousel on pets.html will not load images beyond image 3. Workaround found by manually setting slide to actions for buttons post-3 but animations are still choppy and app still freezes. Further testing + bugfix needed. Wrap-boolean set to true but wrap does not work.

* Carousel on pets.html causes flex issues. Cannot display footer on page, so opted to remove footer.

* Accordion + footer on interests.html For some reason, the accordion does not expand the page length, so the accordion text overlays on the footer and footer text can still be seen. Workaround found by setting class on div and setting z-index of accordion to 2 so accordion + accordion background color will always cover footer.
