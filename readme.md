### Future Implementations:
* Splash Screen!
* Scrollspy ?

### Challenges:
* Carousel on pets.html will not load images beyond image 3. Workaround found by manually setting slide to actions for buttons post-3 but animations are still choppy and app still freezes. Further testing + bugfix needed. Wrap-boolean set to true but wrap does not work.

* Loading issue on pets.html causes nav <li> to sometimes not be clickable? unclear 

* ~~Carousel on pets.html causes flex issues. Cannot display footer on page, so opted to remove footer.~~  3/18 fix footer issues

* ~~footer still showing extra body margin-bottom on index.html~~ fixed 3/18

* ~~Accordion + footer on interests.html For some reason, the accordion does not expand the page length, so the accordion text overlays on the footer and footer text can still be seen.~~ Workaround found by setting class on div and setting z-index of accordion to 2 so accordion + accordion background color will always cover footer. 

### Surprisingly fun things:
* Documentation! Enjoyed keeping track of bugs and resources, and building out this readme

* Git process. Utilized branching to trial new features, such as Bootstrap without risking functional code.

### Resources:
* utilized [Color Designer](https://colordesigner.io/) to generate a swatch of complementary colors
* utilized [Accessible Colors](https://accessible-colors.com/) to test for contrast accessibility of main-content text using WCAG 2.0 guidelines
